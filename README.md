# Harry Potter
<img width="2295"  height="504" alt="series image" src="https://github.com/H-Maurya/HarryPotter-x-Hacktoberfest/blob/main/poster.jpg">

Harry Potter, the beloved wizarding world created by J.K. Rowling, holds a special place in the hearts of many, evoking powerful feelings of childhood nostalgia. For those who grew up with Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the enchanting Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the series is more than just books and filmsâ€”it's a time capsule of our own youthful adventures. The tales of magic, friendship, and bravery transported readers and viewers to a world where the impossible became possible, where the ordinary could become extraordinary. Childhood nostalgia intertwines with Harry Potter, reminding us of a time when we believed in the magic of both fictional and real-life adventures, where the longing for a letter from Hogwarts was just as real as the characters themselves. The enchantment of Harry Potter transcends generations, continuing to bring comfort and joy as we revisit the stories and share them with new readers, passing the torch of nostalgia from one childhood to the next.

With Hacktoberfest 2023 coming up, I decided to create this repository that's actually a very basic web-page that lets the user view and add their favourite characters.

You can find all types characters [here](https://heroes-and-villain.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Harry_Potter_characters).

# Contents of the Webpage

1. index.html - Contains the content of the main/home page.
2. style.css -  Contains the styling given to the home page.
3. script.js - Contains dynamically generated character cards.

# What can you contribute?

There is always something to contribute to a project whether you are a novice or a veteran. In this project, you can add your favourite character as a card to the website! Or maybe you didn't like the line that you are reading right now and want to change that. Sure! Why not?

# But what if i don't know how to add cards? :(

Not everyone is aware of every tool present in the world no matter how easy or complex it is. It's also not necessary to know each and every tool out there. Use the code below to add the your own card!

<b>Code -</b> 

                <!-- [character name] card start-->
                <div class="card">
                  <img src="img/[name].png" alt="[name]">
                  <div class="container">
                      <h4><strong>[name]</strong></h4>
                      <p class="desc">[Character Description]</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <!--[character name] card end-->

Copy this code and paste it in the index.html file to make your changes. Try and test it on your own system and then create a Pull Request. You can adjust height of image of character so that it will fit in card.
